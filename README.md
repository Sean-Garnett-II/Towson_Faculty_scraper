# Towson Faculty Scraper

This scraper pulls the names, emails, phone numbers, and Rooms to Towson University's Physics Department (my Alma mater).

This is my first scraping script. I used this as a simple project to practice the methods used in scraping and potentialy as use for future reference.

This was also my first indepth look at Regex syntax and BeautifulSoup4.

Note: Libraries used requests, bs4, datetime, and re.
